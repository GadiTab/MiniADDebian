Welcome to the Mini Active Directory for Linux by GadiTab.
This is my first "big" project in Python. It was made for studies and fun.
You can feel free to look on the code and use it.
Except for a specific change I made few months ago, I probably won't update this project again unless people will ask me.


Have Fun!
